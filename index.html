                            <img src="img/portfolio/pp2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>This is a simple personal webpage I created using a plain text editor to share insight into my life, travels, and life goals. I chose not to use a template for this site because I wanted to challenge myself to build a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to test my knowledge as well as learn how to do new things. I felt by making a website from scratch, I would push myself to learn, grow, and have a better understanding of web development. Javascript is an area that I've been focusing on developing my skills further in and I have learned a lot from online sources like w3 while making the photo slideshow as well as making a dynamic website.</p>

                            <p>I learned to make this webpage dynamic from css-tricks by utilizing section tags and JQuery Javascript to only change the content of the page once a button is clicked. Also, I learned how to use a Javascript array along with the Math.floor(math.random) function to randomly display a new inspirational quote everytime the page is refreshed. By working on this webpage, I even learned the value of css &commat;media rules that allowed me to style the page differently if viewed on another device with a different width, height, resolution, or orientation. Creating this webpage reaffirmed my passion for web development as hours seemed to fly by as I coded, learned, and improved this page. Once it was completed, I felt very accomplished and a step closer to my goals.</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/cpst2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>This assignment was a capstone project I worked on in a group along with two other classmates. This project was pivotal as it had to be presented infront of the Dean along with other school officials to display skills we have learned in order to graduate. The requirements for this capstone project were to build a website along with a functioning database for either an upstart medical institution or daycare. As a team, we decided to go with the medical institution because it seemed to be more of a challenge and assigned different responsibilies to complete this project.</p>

                            <p>David was in charge of the database since he had more experience with databases, Carlos was assigned the project manager role as well as documenting the progress, and I was in charge of the creative development of the webpage. I chose to go with a clean modern design that emphasized this made up medical institution was a state of the art facility for anything that ails you. I came up with all the wording, color palette, and coding alterations to specfically meet our needs for this project.
